# LED-Heart-Chaser
Little project that I made as a gift for others. It is a LED chaser circuit that would turn on LEDs in a heart shape when plugged into a USB port. 
It uses a NE555 timer and a 4017 counter for the chaser circuit. It is a 4 layer board (signal layers 1 and 4, VCC layer 3, and GND layer 2)
Hand soldered the SMD components on the PCB when I got the board from Oshpark.com (sourced the components from Mouser.com).

Here is the schematic:
